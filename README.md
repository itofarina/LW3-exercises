# Learn Web3 DAO - exercises
Just an aggregation of the exercises from the awesome course of [LearnWeb3 DAO](https://github.com/LearnWeb3DAO) on a single project.

## Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
